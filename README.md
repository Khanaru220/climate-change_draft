## Our presentation

### Introduce
[![Presentation by Ramiz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74447462/234072154-82c9a7d2-a331-4f8d-9ea8-9d6be137ed91.png)](https://youtu.be/ubM7dP5CAnA)

### Inspiration

The primary objective of this project was to discover methods for encouraging people to adopt greener lifestyles. By promoting the consumption of locally sourced foods, we can reduce the demand for imported goods, subsequently decreasing the carbon footprint associated with the transportation of these items over long distances.

### What it does

As a user, I can select my location and food preferences to receive recommendations for local foods available within my diet. This enables me to shop locally, lowering my carbon footprint and supporting sustainable practices.

### How we built it

The app's design was conceptualized using Figma, and subsequently developed with Firebase, JavaScript, and React.

### Challenges we ran into

Building this application presented several challenges. One significant obstacle was assembling the right team, with members possessing the necessary skills and time to commit to the project. Another challenge involved obtaining live data to support the app using an API, as there was insufficient time to find location data linked to specific foods.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We take pride in the app's visually appealing design and its meaningful and impactful concept. Once launched, we believe this app would be well-received by users. Additionally, the project's developer worked diligently to advance the project and is dedicated to finding a viable solution.

### What we learned

In future projects, we recognize that conducting thorough research and planning in advance will provide a more solid foundation for success.

### What's next for Fresh Finds

Our team is committed to refining this solution and transforming the app into a fully functional product, making a positive impact on users and the environment.
